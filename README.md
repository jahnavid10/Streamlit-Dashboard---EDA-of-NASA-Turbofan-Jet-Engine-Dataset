#  NASA Turbofan Engine Degradation - EDA & Preprocessing
This project is focused on interactive exploration and preprocessing of the NASA C-MAPSS dataset, which simulates engine degradation over time. The dataset is used extensively in predictive maintenance, prognostics, and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation tasks.
Using Streamlit, this app offers both code-based notebooks and interactive dashboards to:
 - Visualize engine lifecycle and health patterns
 - Calculate RUL per engine
 - Identify redundant or irrelevant features
 - Prepare data for machine learning pipelines
